User Formats prototyping tool
=============================

The purpose of this app is to allow for *rapid* prototyping of html layouts that can
be linked together and published publicly for user testing.

It exists for the following reasons:

* To make it easier to create structured layouts based on a grid system
* To avoid the time and code overhead of having to prototype on branches of govuk repos.
* To allow us to easily publish prototypes for testing (using Heroku)
